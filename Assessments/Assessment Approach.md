# Assessment Approach

With a goal to determine the Government of Canada's (GC) preferred open source
platforms, the following steps are being taken to ensure an open and
collaborative process.

**1. Design assessment criteria based on:**

- Existing Government of Canada policies, standards, and guidelines
- Open standards and best practices
- Domain-specific industry standards and best practices
- Sample criteria template can be found [here] (https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/Assessments/Template.md)

**2. Collaborative assessment against criteria:**

- Leveraging open source knowledge from domain experts to complete assessments
- GC Configurations to be assessed will be contributed by the community based on
  existing and emerging tools
- If you would like to assess a tool that you don't see listed, [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
  for a new file, and use the [template](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/Assessments/Template.md)

**3. Consult with open source community:**

- Assessments will be shared through existing open source communities within and
  external to the GC
- Communities of practice are being established to help develop assessments,
  validate criteria, and consult with domain experts in a meaningful way.
- Consultations will be completed online and in-person

**4. GC Governance:**

- Following the completion of the collaborative design process for assessment,
  consultations, recommendations for preferred open source platforms will be
  provided to the GC's Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB).
- If recommendation for preferred tool is approved by EARB, it will be added to
  the list of [Preferred Open Platforms](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/9_Preferred_Open_Platforms.md).
- Internal governance will continue to adopt preferred platforms within
  necessary GC Standards and Guidelines.
