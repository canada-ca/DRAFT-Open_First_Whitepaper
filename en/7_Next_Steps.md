## Next Steps

### Things the GC has done

#### October 2017 - [Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning Digital Government with the United Kingdom](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/memorandum-understanding-concerning-digital-government.html)

Mutually support each other's goals to:

> Promote economic growth through open markets and by stimulating start-ups and small to medium business enterprises; and

> Commit to open standards for government information, data and software, promoting interoperability and the development of Open Source solutions that can be shared.

#### November 2017 - [GC Strategic Plan for IM and IT 2017-2021](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/strategic-plan-2017-2021.html) new planned actions

> Introduce a strategy for use of open source software and open standards

> The use of open source software supports interoperability and information sharing and should be considered in the assessment of IM-IT solutions. Open source products are publicly available, and the availability of their source code promotes open and collaborative development around their specifications, making them more robust and interoperable. The use of open standards ensures interoperability between products and systems, and maintains flexibility within the IM-IT environment. TBS will lead the development of a strategy to set direction for the government on the use and release of open source software and open standards that will be ratified by GC EARB.

#### December 2017 - [GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) endorsements](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/9/98/GC_EARB_2017-12-14_Record_of_Discussion.pdf) (GCpedia)

GC EARB members endorsed the following:

> The GC has used and will continue to use open source tools as key components of its technology ecosystem when it makes sense to do so;

> Members of the GC EARB support the formalization of a common GC-wide approach to the adoption of open source within government, resulting in a more robust open community within the GC."

#### February 2018 - [Canada signs the D7 charter](https://ipolitics.ca/2018/02/22/canada-joins-club-worlds-digital-government-leaders/)

> Ministers from member countries signed the D7 charter, which calls for commitments to open standards, open source, open government and teaching children to code.

#### February 2018 - First meeting of the [Open Source Advisory Board](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO) (OSAB) at TBS

### Things the GC is set to complete

#### [Open First Whitepaper](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper)

- Case for open standards and open source software
- Best practices and guidelines
  - Endorsed and preferred open Standards
  - Use open source software
  - Publish open source code
  - Become an open organization

### [Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/)

- List of open Standards with EARB endorsement, as well as others being used in Canadian public administrations
- List of OSS being used in Canadian public administrations
- List of open source code released by Canadian public administrations

#### [Digital Principles](https://open.canada.ca/en/blog/digital-principles) (Alpha version)

Published version coming soon!

#### [Digital Playbook](https://github.com/canada-ca/digital-playbook-guide-numerique)

- Detailed version of the digital principles
- How to apply the principles

### Recommended Next Steps

#### OSAB and EARB endorsements

##### Open Standards

- **Endorsement of current open Standards identified in the GC standard on Web interoperability and GC standard on Web accessibility**
  - HTML5, UTF-8, RDFa Lite, Schema.org, Atom
  - WCAG 2.0

- **Require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) store and manage data with open Standards**
  - Factor in the use of open Standards when calculating total cost of ownership of a solutions including exit or transition costs
  - EARB process to support active application when adopting solutions

- **Endorsement of current preferred (pilots, principles, guidelines) open Standards in the GC**
  - Open Contracting Data Standard (PSPC Open Contracting Data Standard pilot)
  - PDF/A, EPUB3, XML, CSV (GC open data/information principles)
  - EPUB3, PDF/A, ODF, EML, MBOX, .. (LAC guidelines on file formats for transferring information resources of enduring value)

- **Align with UK open standards for government**
  - Adopt open Standards selected by UK Open Standards Board
    - HTML5, PDF/A, ODF, Open Contracting Data Standard, vCard, iCalendar, ..
  - Collaborate with UK to select new open standards for governments
  - Adapt and adopt UK guidance on ODF and procurement to GC

##### Open Source Software use

- **Endorse open source Web browser, office suite and other productivity tools for use by all departments and agencies' workplace technology devices**
  - Plan to eliminate current lock-in to closed-source operating system by favoring use of open source multi-platform or Web applications

- **Require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) actively and fairly consider OSS during procurement**
  - Select OSS on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility, when there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost (TCO) difference with closed-source solutions
  - EARB process to support active application when adopting solutions

- **Use OSS components in development projects and build solutions based on existing OSS**

##### Open Source Software contribution

- **Support and be an active contributor (code, issues, testing, roadmap, ..) to OSS used by the GC and/or where there is benefit to Canadians**
- **Support initiatives such as the The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) to help ensure that critical libraries for modern Internet communications are monitored and supported**

##### Release code developed internally as under OSS licenses

- **Publish as OSS all source code created or modified, whether developed in-house by government staff or through negotiated contracts**
- **Encourages contributions to its OSS projects, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction**

##### Open Source Software Community Building

- **Provide awards and recognition for departments, units and individuals using open standards and open source software in the GC**

### Other

#### Open Standards adoption strategy

- configure existing solutions to use open standards where possible;
- update cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on open standards.

#### OSS adoption strategy

- factor in the use of OSS when calculating total cost of ownership (TCO) of a solutions including exit or transition costs;
- update cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on OSS;

#### OSS contribution strategy

- comply to the licenses of OSS projects they contribute to;
