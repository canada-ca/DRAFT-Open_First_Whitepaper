## Open Culture

Government has not been built to be Open First. To become open by default, government will require significant changes to the policies, practices and the culture of the institution.

It is not that civil servants will be acting without checks & balances, but working with business, NGOs and citizens government can be held to a greater degree of accountability. To do this though requires that government become more porus. 

Governments around the world have adopted open source software and in the last decade there has been a movement to publish that code. There are great examples of how open coding improves the quality not only of the code produced, but it also makes it easier to hire more qualified programmers. More people these days want to be able to work for a broader purpose, and working in the open allows developers to work on some of the biggest challenges that face humanity today. 

Normalizing this process so that it filters down beyond the innovative hubs of government, but into the basic boilier-plates of how work is done will take time. An Open First approach will affect not only the technologists, but will affecte everyone from the procurement officers to the politicians. 

The Government of Canaada is the countries single largest employer, adopting an Open First approach will have huge benefits to build a more innovative, inclusive and agile country. If Canada wants to be a leader in the 21st Century, there is no better way to fill this space.
