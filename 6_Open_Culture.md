## Open Culture

To become open by default, government will require changes to the policies, practices, and the culture of the institution.

Governments around the world have adopted open source software and in the last decade there has been a movement to publish the new code that they develop as open source software. There are great examples of how open coding improves the quality of the code produced and makes it easier to hire more qualified programmers. Working in the open allows developers to share in some of the big challenges, and have their code contributions exposed to a larger audience.

Normalizing this process so that it filters down from the innovative hubs of government and into the basic method of work will take time. An Open First approach will affect not only the technologists, but will affect everyone from the procurement officers to the politicians.

The Government of Canada is the countries' largest employer. Adopting an Open First approach will have huge benefits. Canada can lead in more innovative, inclusive, and agile government.
