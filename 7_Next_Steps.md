## Next Steps

### Done

#### November 2017 - GC Strategic Plan for IM and IT 2017-2021 new planned actions

> Introduce a strategy for use of open source software and open standards

> The use of open source software supports interoperability and information sharing and should be considered in the assessment of IM-IT solutions. Open source products are publicly available, and the availability of their source code promotes open and collaborative development around their specifications, making them more robust and interoperable. The use of open standards ensures interoperability between products and systems, and maintains flexibility within the IM-IT environment. TBS will lead the development of a strategy to set direction for the government on the use and release of open source software and open standards that will be ratified by GC EARB.

#### December 2017 - GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) endorsments:
> Canada will use open source tools as key components of it's technology eco-system

> Members will support the creation and adoption open source throughout their practice, resulting in a robust open community within the GC

### To do

#### EARB endorsments

- Current GC preferred open standards;
  - HTML5, UTF-8, RDFa Lite, Schema.org, Atom (GC Standard on Web interoperability)
  - WCAG 2.0 (GC Standard on Web accessibility)
  - Open Contracting Data Standard (PSPC pilot)
  - PDF/A, EPUB3, XML, CSV (GC open data principles)

- LAC guidelines on file formats for transferring information resources of enduring value and PCH Elements of a technical interoperability framework recommended file formats.
  - EPUB3, PDF/A, ODF, ..

- Allignment with UK open standards for government
  - Adopt open standards selected by UK
  - Collaborate with UK to select new open standards for governments
  - Adapt UK guidance on ODF and procurement

- Selection of open source Web browser, office suite and other productivity tools for use by all departments and agencies

- Plan to eliminate current lock-in to proprietary operating system by favouring use of multi-platform or Web applications

##### Open Standards adoption strategy

- configure existing solutions to use open standards where possible;
- require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) store and manage data with open standards;
- factor in the use of open standards when calculating total cost of ownership of a solutions including exit or transition costs;
- update cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on open standards.

##### OSS adoption strategy

- require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations actively and fairly consider OSS, starting immediately;
- factor in the use of OSS when calculating total cost of ownership (TCO) of a solutions including exit or transition costs;
- select OSS on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility, when there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost difference with proprietary solutions;
- update cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on OSS;
- use OSS components in our development projects;

##### OSS contribution strategy

- support and be an active contributor (code, issues, testing, roadmap, ..) to OSS projects that it or its clients utilize;
- comply to the licenses of OSS projects they contribute to;
- support initiatives such as the The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) to help ensure that critical libraries for modern internet communications are monitored and supported.

##### Guidance for release of code developed internally as OSS

- publish as OSS all source code created or modified, whether developed in-house by government staff or through negotiated contracts;
- encourages contributions to its OSS projects, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction;
