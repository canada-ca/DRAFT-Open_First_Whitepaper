## Next Steps

### Strategic Actions

#### Open Standards

- endorse preferred open standards for use by all departments and agencies;
- use commonly accepted open standards for open data and information;
- configure existing solutions to use open standards where possible;
- require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions) store and manage data with open standards;
- factor in the use of open standards when calculating total cost of ownership of a solutions including exit or transition costs;

#### Open Source Software

- require that all new purchases, upgrades or migrations actively and fairly consider OSS, starting immediately;
- factor in the use of OSS when calculating total cost of ownership (TCO) of a solutions including exit or transition costs;
- select OSS on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility, when there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost difference with proprietary solutions;
- publish OSS adoption guidelines, update IM-IT strategic plan (done) and cloud adoption strategy to reflect direction on OSS;
- develop generic procurement policies for OSS (Review & assess the [following policies](https://github.com/mgifford/open-source-contracting))
- maintain a list of preferred OSS to guide departments and agencies looking for OSS;
- plan to eliminate current lock-in to proprietary operating system by favouring use of multi-platform or Web applications;

#### Open Source Code

- publish guidance for departments and agencies to release code developed internally as OSS;
- create a Github site in the spirit of https://github.com/alphagov and https://github.com/18F, possibly by expanding https://github.com/cds-snc , and make it open to new GC projects.
- use OSS components in our projects and contribute back to the community;
- publish as OSS all source code created or modified, whether developed in-house by government staff or through negotiated contracts;
- encourages contributions to its OSS projects, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction;
- comply to the licenses of OSS projects they contribute to.
- maintain a list of preferred OSS licences and code repositories to guide departments and agencies publishing OSS;

### Communications

- Highlight government projects which depend on OSS
- Highlight OSS projects used by the government
- Raise awareness about OSS champions in Canada (both inside & outside government)
- Ensure it is a talking point for senior bureaucrats & Members of Cabinet
