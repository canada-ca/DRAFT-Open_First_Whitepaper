## Open Platforms
It is recognized that different department and organization across the Canadian federal government need specialized development tools and platforms. It is of value, however, to share the open toolkit that has been approved through the federal government in order to promote a level of standardization that will allow for expertise sharing, greater transparency on the toolkit being used and community engagement on the tools that should be used. This will give the opportunity for the open community to comment, suggest enhancements and identify opportunities within the federal technological landscape.

This list is also of use to share expertise, experience and best practices amongst federal organization, promote innovation and help accelerate the open initiative by allowing for information sharing on the tools being used.

This list is only of value if it is regularly updated, as such, the information should be updated regularly upon changes and update.

Below, you will find the development stack used by the Public Service Commission of Canada for its new development initiatives since 2017.
