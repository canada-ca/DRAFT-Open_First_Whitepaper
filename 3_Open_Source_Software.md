### Terminology
Source code is the human readable version of software.  The code is written by developers and can be read and modified by others.  The code can be compiled into an executable or binary, that is not readable.

Free software and open source software is software where the source code is distributed and can be used, copied, studied and redistributed without restrictions.

Free software is the original name put forward by Richard Stallman and defended by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  Free software is defined by [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).  The freedom to run the program, study how it works, modify it and redistribute it.  Access to the source code is a precondition for these freedoms and not the end goal itself.

Open Source Software is the name used by the Open Source Initiative. They're the authority on certifying whether a software licence is an open source licence.  Open source software is defined in the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) by 10 criteria.

Free in English can mean something is available at no cost, or that it gives you certain freedoms. Much is available online comparing free speech, free beer & even free kittens as metaphors for free software.

Free software and open source software are almost equivalent but represent two different visions and neither want to be included in the other.  You will find authors using "free open source software (FOSS)" or "free/Libre open source software (FLOSS)".  For the purposes of this whitepaper we opted to use "open source software (OSS)" to talk about free (in the sense of freedom) software and open source software.

### History
OSS goes back to the beginnings of computer science. Many of the successes of Open Government could only be possible because of open source code and the generosity of internet communities. We should pay that back.

### Benefits
Using OSS allows for product customization, advances interoperability between tools, and improves the overall quality of the final product. Other benefits include:
- **Flexible usage.** The benefits of using OSS compel GC to meet user needs by modifying existing or creating new OSS. OSS is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team.
- **Community involvement.** Publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves.
- **Cost-savings.** The ability to modify OSS enables GC to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely the Government of Canada.
- **Reusability.** The code we create belongs to the public as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in OSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and individuals can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at GC.

### Security

One of the most misunderstood aspects of the Open Source Software (OSS) development model is the security benefits it offers. OSS security relies on genuinely hardened code that is tested by a large number of reviewers in a wide variety of circumstances. Linus Torvalds simply noted, "talk is cheap, show me the code."

#### Reliance on Hardening, Not Obfuscation

Hiding code does not prevent attacks—and it it foolish to assume that it does. Open Source development practices rely on actually hardening (or improving the security of) code by making it available for peers to test and try to break, and then fixing the problems found.

OSS is not always more secure, however in both theory and practice the OSS security model has proven that it can more quickly respond to and correct security issues. 

Obfuscation relies on attacker ignorance and hides poor security practices. Within five months of the source code release of InterBase version 6, a hard-coded backdoor that had existed for seven years was found by the OSS community and fixed.

#### Wide Peer Review

Assuming that the goal is to make secure software, it is obvious that the easiest way to find flaws in a project is to make all of the project's code completely transparent. This approach may seem counter-intuitive, if the ultimate goal is anything other than the integrity of the technology.

By openly releasing a project's code and making it readily available via the Internet the community of peer reviewers is expanded exponentially across the globe. The community will quickly find flaws and the project team can take action to fix them. This simultaneously garners exceptionally wide and deep testing feedback from developers who need the code to be as secure as possible for their own use as well as the community's. Both the project owners and community benefit from sharing flaws and fixes.

#### Look Good Naked

Jim Whitehurst, Red Hat CEO, summed up the OSS security model by saying, "If we all had to walk around naked we'd all spend more time in the gym." Because the OSS security model is established on industry-accepted best practices and the actual code is widely available, projects are widely reviewed, thoroughly scrutinized, practically improved and quickly hardened.

"Lock-picking is a dying art. Not because basic lock technology has changed all that much since it was invented, but because it's just easier to break a window" noted Kane McLean of BRTRC Technology Research Corporation. "Cyber attacks follow the path of least resistance, if the security obstacles are open and known that becomes a deterrent in itself." When the strength of a project is well known, atteckers tend to search for another path of attack

### Development
OSS is how modern organizations build software. Documented advantages over software built by a handful of developers include the quality of solutions generated through the diversity of ideas and communities that form around a shared challenge. Exposing the problem space to other interested organizations also provides additional human capital to tackle challenges. For example, Linux, an open source operating system, is the largest development project in the world, with thousands of people contributing to every release. Many competing companies contribute to Linux and other OSS, allowing them to leverage the work of a global community of OSS developers and shift developers from low-value work to high-value work.

#### Contributing to projects

### Publishing code
