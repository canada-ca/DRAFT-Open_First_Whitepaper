## Definitions
**Free Software** is software that respects users' freedom and community. The term “free” is more a matter of liberty than price, as it refers to the users’ freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. For most practical puproses it means the same as Open Source Software, although this is widely debated.

**Interoperability** can be defined as an environment where people, processes and systems work in such a fashion that the right information is available to the right people at the right time to meet their business objectives.   

**Open standards** a standard which is transparent, currently relevant, open for participation, impartiality and built by consensus, available for free, and maintained by an active community.

**Open Source Software** is software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

**Open Source Hardware** are tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things.

**Version control system** software product or service designed to store and retrieve several versions of source code and related assets in a consistent way, can be centralised, decentralised or distributed.
